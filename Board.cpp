Otherwise, it will return true after sowing the beans: the beans are removed from hole (s,hole) and sown counterclockwise, including s's pot if encountered, but skipping s's opponent's pot. The function sets the parameters endSide and endHole to the side and hole where the last bean was placed. (This function does not make captures or multiple turns; different Kalah variants have different rules about these issues, so dealing with them should not be the responsibility of the Board class.)

Otherwise, it will return true after setting the number of beans in the indicated hole or pot to the value of the third parameter. (This could change what beansInPlay and totalBeans return if they are called later.) This function exists solely so that we and you can more easily test your program: None of your code that implements the member functions of any class is allowed to call this function directly or indirectly. (We'll show an example of its use below.)
